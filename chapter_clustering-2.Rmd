# Need for validation of clusters 
Clustering algorithms are designed such that they come out with a given number of clusters even if the underlying data is devoid of any such clusters.
We will see a criterion to assess the credibility of the clusters produced by any clustering algorithm.

## Within-groups sum of squared distances (WSS): 

$$
WSS_k =  \sum_{l=1}^k{\sum_{x_i \in {C_l}}{d^2(x_i, \overline{x_l})}}
$$
