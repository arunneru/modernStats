# modernStats

This repository contains all the files resulting from our bi-monthly meeting where we read sections from the book (Modern statistics for modern biology) [https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/].


This includes notes from reading the book, scripts derived from the book and any additional exercises we discussed in our meetings.
